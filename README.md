# burger

This is the most elementary of CRUD apps...  missing the D.

You create a new burger (simply by naming it) and then digitally devour it, updating the database in doing so. 

This app uses Node, Express, & Handlebars.  


## Where

You can find it deployed on Heroku here: 
https://cloudy-burger.herokuapp.com/

and to GitHub here: 
https://github.com/ehlerorngard/burger


## Requisites

To clone down the repo and run on your own computer, you'll need to create your own database using the .sql files in the db folder of the app.  

You'll also need to enter your connection credentials in the connection.js file in the config folder.  

Don't forget to install the node packages in the package.json file: 

```
$ npm install
```
